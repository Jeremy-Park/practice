            Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of
            the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of
            a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet,
            in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center
            — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth,
            if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not
            in theory.

            Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both
            good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early
            warnings about technological dangers also come from science.

            What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man
            set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

            A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon
            seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators.
            That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not
            help but love and cherish her.

            For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds
            and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly
            changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are
            far more valuable than those which divide us.

            There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’
            Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the
            generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is
            always the thrill of just beginning.

            The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of
            tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much

            As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in
            size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful
            you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so
            fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would
            crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

            Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship
            Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to
            seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man
            has gone before.

            As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort
            of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must
            explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.
